# py-shattered-pixel-dungeon

This is a shattered-pixel-dungeon demo (just begin) writen in python3 with pygame and love.

The code is based on 
[shattered-pixel-dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon.git) by 
[00-Evan](https://github.com/00-Evan) and 
[pixel-dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon.git) by 
[Watabou](https://github.com/watabou). I do not ues the code directly, but read and rewrite instead.
(when I have no idea, I use the source.)
I learned a lot. Besides, the fov algorithm used is based on an article 
[Symmetric Shadowcasting](https://www.albertford.com/shadowcasting/). Really a good article. 
This [tcod tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2) also teaches me a lot.

Note that __this repository does not accept pull requests!__ The code here is provided in hopes that
